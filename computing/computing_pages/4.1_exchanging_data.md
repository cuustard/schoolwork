# Exchanging Data

## Reducingw data requirements
Text image and sound data can significantly reduce size.

Reducing data to send or store ensures that:
- Data is 

## Compressing Data
There are 2 types of compressionm:

### Lossy
Non-essential data is permanently removed.  EG frequencies of sound that humans can not hear

#### JPG
removes data perm to reduce file size.  
tries to reconstruct image without the missing data.  
So file size is decreases as well as quality.

#### MP3
Removes sound in the frequency ranges that we cannot perceive.  
Quiter notes played at the same time as louder sounds are also removed.

### Lossless
Patterns in the data are spotted and summarised in a shorter format without and information.  
using this method, a new file can be replicated exeactly without loss.  
Reduction is less

#### Run Length Encoding of Sound
A sound recording could have thousands of samples taken every second (44,000)
- teh same sound or note played fora fraction of a second could result in hundreds of identical samples
- RLE records one example of the sample and how many times it is consecutively repeated.

#### Dictionary Compression
Spots regularly occuring data and stores it separately in a dictionary.
- reference to entry dictionary is stored in the main file so reduces original data stored

##### Compressing larger volumes
in a text

# 1.1 Processor Components

## The Central Processing Unit (CPU)

Contains these parts:

-   Control Unit
-   Arithmetic-Logic Unit
-   Registers
-   Busses

## Control Unit:

-   Coordinates activities of the CPU
-   Sends control signals along the control bus between the CU and other components.
-   Synchronises operations of the fetch-decode-execute cycle (FDE cycle)

## Busses:

A bus is a connector that transfers signals between internal components.
Busses are a series of connectors.
They normally contain 8, 16, 32 or 64 lines.

### System Bus

...contains 3 busses:

| Bus     | Function                                                                            |
| :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Address | Carries the memory addresses that of data                                           |
| Data    | Carries the binary 1s and 0s that make up the data being transmitted around the CPU |
| Control | Carries commands and control signals to and from every coponent of the CPU/computer |

## Control Signals

| Signal       | Description                                                                      |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Memory Read  | Causes data from the addressed location in RAM, to be placed on the data bus     |
| Memory Write | Causes data on the data bus to be written into the addressed location in the RAM |
| Bus Request  | Indicates that a device is requesting use of the data bus                        |
| Bus Grant    | Indicates that the CPU has granted access to the data bus                        |
| Clock        | Is a timing pulse used to synchronise operations                                 |

| Registers                          | Function(s)                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Arithmetic logic Unit (ALU)        | Performs arithmetic operations such as, add, subtract, mutiply and divide<br>Performs logical operations such as AND, OR NOT, XOR<br>Performs Shift operations such as left or right binary shift |
| Accumulator (ACC)                  | Temporarily stores results, as it is faster memory than RAM<br>The single general-purpose register                                                                                                |
| Program Counter (PC)               | Holds the address of the next instruction to execute                                                                                                                                              |
| Current Instruction Register (CIR) | Holds the current instruction (made up of opcode and operand) being executed                                                                                                                      |
| Memory Address Register (MAR)      | Holds the address of the memory location of data or an instruction that needs to be fetched or written                                                                                            |
| Memory Data Register (MDR)         | Temporarily stores the data moving between the CPU and RAM                                                                                                                                        |

## Executing Instructions

The CPU has to:

-   temporarily hold the current instruction being executed
-   hold, addresses of the data, and the data itself
-   keep track of the address of the next instruction

## Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle

Processors operate in defined stages used to carry out out program instructions.

### Fetch:

1. Adddress of the next instruction, is copied from the <b>Program counter</b> to the <b>Memory Address Register</b>.
2. Instruction at that address is copied to the <b>Memory Data Register</b>.
3. <b>Program Counter</b> is incrimented by 1.
4. Contents of the <b>Memory Data Register</b> is copied to the <b>Current Instruction Register</b>.

### Decode:

5. Instruction in the <b>Current Instruction Register</b> is decoded (split into operand and opcode to determine the type of instruction).
6. Decoded instruction then passed to the <b>Accumulator</b>.

### Execute:

7. The instruction is then executed and the result is held in the <b>accumulator</b> or memory.

# Summary

The CPU is the brain of the CPU and contains the control unit, buses, ALU. and registers. The Control Unit coordinates the activities of the CPU by sending control signals and is responsible for the FDE cycle. Buses are a series of connectors that transfer those signals. Registers are superfast, but small, storages that stores results, data and memory addresses. The FDE cycle uses registers.

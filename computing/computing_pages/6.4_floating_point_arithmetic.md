# Floating Point Arithmitic

when decomal numbers become too large they are put into standard form (m \* 10<sup>n</sup>).  
Where m is the mantissa and n is the exponent.

The first bit is the sign bit. the last 3 is the exponent. the middle is the mantissa:  
0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1

For example, convert 0.1101100 0100 to denary, assuming an 8 bit mantissa and 4 bit exponent:

-   Mantissa is 0.1101100
-   Exponent is 0100
-   Convert Exponent to denary is 4
-   Binary point of the mantissa has to be moved 4 places to the right to multiply by 2<sup>4</sup>
-   So it looks like 01101.100
-   01101.100 \* 2<sup>4</sup>

## Negative floating point numbers

Start with 1 (sign bit). assuming 4 bit exponent:  
So 1.00101000011 has negative mantissa and posotive exponent.

-   Mantissa is 1.0010100
-   flip: 0.1101011
-   add 1: 0.1101100
-   Exponent: 0011
-   translate to denary is 3
-   0110.1100
-   -6.75

## Negative Exponent

If the exponent is negative, the binary point move left instead of right.
E.G. convert 0.1100000 1110

-  mantissa is 0.11000000
-  translate exponent to decimal: 1110 = -2
-  mantiass moves 2 places left
- binary is 0.0011000 = 0.125 + 0.0625 = 0.1875

## Normalisation

The process of moving the binary point of a floating point number, in order to get the max level of precision for a given number.  
This is a=gained by ensuring that the first digit after the binary number is a significant digit.  
  
The mantissa of a positive number in normalised form lies between 1 and 0.5.  
E.G. normalise the binary number: 0.0011010 0100
- needs to move 2 so the first 1 is after the decimal point
- so move it 2 times.
- so take 2 away from exponent
- so 0.1101000 0010

E.G. Normalise the binary number: 0.0000111 0111
- needs to move 4.
- so move it 4
- now take 4 away from exponent
- so 0.1110000 0011

17.5 = 010001.01
0.1000101 0101

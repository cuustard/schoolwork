# Floating Point Arithmitic

when decomal numbers become too large they are put into standard form (m * 10<sup>n</sup>).  
Where m is the mantissa and n is the exponent.


The first bit is the sign bit. the last 3 is the exponent. the middle is the mantissa:  
0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1

For example, convert 0.1101100 0100 to denary, assuming an 8 bit mantissa and 4 bit exponent:

- Mantissa is 0.1101100
- Exponent is 0100
- Convert Exponent to denary is 4
- Binary point of the mantissa has to be moved 4 places to the right to multiply by 2<sup>4</sup>
- So it looks like 01101.100
- 01101.100 * 2<sup>4</sup>

## Negative floating point numbers

Start with 1 (sign bit).  assuming 4 bit exponent:  
So 1.00101000011 has negative mantissa and posotive exponent.  

- Mantissa is 1.0010100
- flip: 0.1101011
- add 1: 0.1101100
- Exponent: 0011
- translate to denary is 3
- 0110.1100

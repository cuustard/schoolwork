<div class="headingTitle2"><h2>Executing Instructions:</h2></div>
<p>The CPU has to:</p>

  <li>keep track of the adress of the next instruction</li>
</ul>
<div class="headingTitle2"><h2>Fetch-decode-execute Cycle</h2></div>

<p>
  Processors operate in defined stages used to carrout out program instructions
</p>
<h3>Fetch:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    The adddress of the next instruction, is copied from the
    <b>Program counter</b> to the <b>Memory Address Register</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    The instruction held at that address is copied to the
    <b>Memory Data Register</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b>Program Counter</b> is then incrimented by 1, to prepare for the next
    cycle
  </li>
  <li>
    The contents of the <b>Memory Data Register</b> is copied to the
    <b>Current Instruction Register</b> to be executed
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Decode:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    The instruction of the <b>Current Instruction Register</b> is decoded (split
    into operand and opcode to determine the type of instruction)
  </li>
  <li>It is then passed to the <b>Accumulator</b></li>
</ol>
<h3>Execute:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    The instruction is then executed and the result is held in the
    <b>accumulator</b> or memory
  </li>
</ol>
<div class="headingTitle1"><h1>Summary</h1></div>
<p>
  The CPU is the brain of the CPU and contains the control unit, buses, ALU. and
  registers. The Control Unit coordinates the activities of the CPU by sending
  control signals and is responsible for the FDE cycle. Buses are a series of
  connectors that transfer those signals. Registers are superfast, but small,
  storages that stores results, data and memory addresses. The FDE cycle uses
  registers.

<div class="headingTitle1"><h1>Revision Questions</h1></div>
<details>
  <summary>What 4 parts make up the CPU?</summary>
  <p>
    The CPU is made up of the control unit (CU), busses, the arithmetic loic
    unit (ALU) and registers.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What 2 things is the control unit responsible for?</summary>
  <p>
    The CU is responsible for coordinating the activitites of the CPU, and the
    fetch-decode-execute cycle (FDEcycle).
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How does the CU coordinate the activities of the CPU?</summary>
  <p>
    The CU coordinates the activities of the CPU by sending control signals
    along the control bus between the CU and other components of the computer.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    What are the 3 buses that make up the system bus, and what does each do?
  </summary>
  <p>
    The address bus carries memory addresses that direct were the data is being
    read or written to.<br />The data bus carries the data being transmitted
    aroung the CPU.<br />The control bus carries control signals to and from
    every component of the CPU and computer
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the 5 control signals used to coordinate the CPU?</summary>
  <p>
    Memory Read causes data from the addressed location in RAM to be put on the
    data bus.<br />Memory Write causes data on the data bus to be written into
    the addressed location in the RAM.<br />Bus Request Indicates that a device
    is requesting use of the data bus.<br />Bus Grant indiciates that the CPU
    has granted access to the data bus.<br />The Clock is a timing pulse used to
    synchonise operations
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the 5 registeres?</summary>
  <p>
    The Accumulator (ACC) temporarily stores results.<br />The program counter
    (PC) holds the address of the next instruction.<br />The Current Instruction
    Register (CIR) holds the current instruction (operand and opcode) being
    executed.<br />The Memory Address Register (MAR) holds the address of the
    memory location of data that needs fetching or to be written to.<br />The
    Memory Data Register (MDR) temporarily stores data moving between the CPU
    and RAM
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe the fetch stage (steps 1-4) of the FDE cycle.</summary>
  <p>
    First, the address of the next instruction is copied from the program
    counter to the memory address register<br />Then the instruction held at
    that address is copied to the memory data register<br />Then the program
    counter is incrimented by 1<br />Finally the contents of the memory data
    register is copiedfrom the current instruction register to be executed
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe the decode stage (steps 5-6) of thet FDE cycle.</summary>
  <p>
    After the fetch stage, the instruction in the current instruction register
    is decoded (split into operandand opcode).<br />Next it is passed to to
    accumulator
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe the execute stage (step 7) of the FDE cycle.</summary>
  <p>
    The instruction is then executed and resultsare stored in the accumulator or
    in memory

# Binary Arithmetic

```
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 0 carry 1
1 + 0 = 1
```

```
0 + 0 + 0 = 0
0 + 0 + 1 = 1
0 + 1 + 1 = 0 carry 1
1 + 1 + 1 = 1 carry 1
1 + 1 + 0 = 0 carry 1
1 + 0 + 0 = 1
```

## Representing Negative Numbers

## Sign and Magnitude.

The first bit acts as the sign, 0 for + and 1 for -.  
Arithmetic does not work when using sign and magnitude.

## Two's complement
Turning back 1 from 00000000 is 11111111.  
  
The two's complement of a signed binary value is found by flipping all the buts and adding 1.

For example:

Find -77<sub>10</sub> in two's complement.

find posotive value first (77):  
01001101 == 77  
  
Flip the bits:
10110010  
  
Add 1:  
10110011 == =77  
  
  
Find 77 in two's complement.  
  
find negative value first (-77):
10110011  
  
Flip the bits:
01001100  
  
Add 1:
01001101

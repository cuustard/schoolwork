# Writin & following algorithms

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions used to solve a problem or task in a finite number of steps.

## Problems solved by algorithms:

- Routing
- Timetabling
- Searching
- Encrypting
- Sorting
- Writing a compiler

### Properties of a good algorithm

- clear steps
- deals with invalid inputs
- terminates at some point
- should perform efficiently
- clear understanding of the algorithm

- well defined variables
- comments
- efficient (short and fast)

## Pseudocode

It is independant of any language. So it can be taken and turned into anything.

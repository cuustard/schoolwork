## Algorithms
DEF: an algorithm is a set of instructions used to solve a problem or task in a finite number of steps.

well defined variables
comments
efficient (short and fast)

### Properties of a good algorithm
- clear steps
- deals with invalid inputs
- terminates at some point
- should perform efficiently
- clear understanding of the algorithm


## Pseudocode
It is independant of any language. So it can be taken and turned into anything.

# Writing & following algorithms

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions used to solve a problem or task in a finite number of steps.  
They solve many problems such as:

-   Routing
-   Timetabling
-   Searching
-   Encrypting
-   Sorting
-   Writing a compiler

### Properties of a good algorithm

-   clear steps
-   deals with invalid inputs
-   terminates at some point
-   should perform efficiently
-   clear understanding of the algorithm
-   well-defined variables
-   comments
-   efficient (short and fast)

## Pseudocode

It is independent of any language. So it can be taken and turned into anything.

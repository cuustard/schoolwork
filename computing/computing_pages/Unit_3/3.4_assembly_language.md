# Assembly Language

Assembly Language is a low-level language.  
It uses mnemonics to represent operation codes.  
There are different assembly languages for each different type of processor.
Assembly is translated by an assembler into machine code.

# The Instruction Set

Little Man Computing (LMC) has 11 instructions.  
The imaginary computer that it runs on has 100 memory locations

## Addressing Modes

The last 2 bits of the opcode specify the addressing mode.  
This specifies whether the operand represents:

-   a value to be used in a calculation
-   memory address of a value to be used
-   address of a register or memory location which holds the memory address of the value to be used
-   an index

| Adressing mode | Description                                             |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| Immediate      | Operand holds actual value                              |
| Direct         | Operand holds the address of the value                  |
| Indirect       | Operand is the location holding the address of thevalue |

### Index Addressing

The address of the operand is obtained by adding a constant value to the contents of a general register (called the index register).  
Used to access any array whose elements are in successive memory locations.  
By incrementing the value in the index register, successive memory locations can be accessed.

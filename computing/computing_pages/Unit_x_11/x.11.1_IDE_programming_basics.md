# The IDE and programming Basics

## The IDE

An IDE is software which enables you to enter, edit, compile and run code.

### Usefull features of the IDE

-   line numbers
-   auto indentation
-   auto-complete commands
-   un/comment code

## Debugging Facilities

Debugging facilitites:

| Facility     | Definition                                                                       |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Breakpoint   | Can set a breakpoint in the program to cause it to stop.                         |
| Watch        | Can set on a variable to display the value of it when it changes.                |
| Step through | When you step through a program one line at a time.                              |
| Trace        | When you trace the execution of a program. Can be done by printing specific text |

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions used to solve a speific problem.

## Pseudocode

A language written in english and represents general code that could be interpreted by any programmer programming in any language.

| Advantage                | Disadvantage        |
| :----------------------- | :------------------ |
| Understood by all        | Not highlighted     |
| Focus on problem solving | Not easily testable |

## Variables and Assignments

An identifier is a name that points to a memory location. Essentially a variable.  
Assignment is used to allocate a value to the memory location. Essentially assigning a vlaue to a variable.

## Data Types

| Data Type     | Eg                       |
| :------------ | :----------------------- |
| String        | "Hello"                  |
| Character     | "H"                      |
| Integer       | 17                       |
| Float (real)  | 17.0                     |
| List (array ) | ["Hello", "H", 17, 17.0] |

## Variables and Constants

Value of a variable can be changed whilist the program is running.  
Value of a CONSTANT can not be chagned whilist the program is running.

Constants reduce the risk of errors by reducing access to the memory location.  
For example, you would define Ï€ as a constant as this mathematical value will never change.

## Operators

MOD is used to find just the remainder of integer division.  
For example, 5 MOD 2 = 1.

DIV is used to find just the integer of division.  
For example, 5 DIV 2 = 2.

## String handling functions

| Function | Example                                                                                                             |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| len()    | print(len("string")) #will return the length of the string, 6                                                       |
| .find()  | name = robert<br>print(name.find("be")) #will return 2 as index pos of first character in find function is at pos 2 |

# Computational Thinking 

Computationally Thinking: The ability to logically think about a problem mand apply techniques to solve it.  
This involves:
- solving problems
- designing systems
- understanding human behaviour by drawing on concepts of computational fundamental computing

## Thinking Abstractly
Abstraction is a way of separating the logical and physical elements of a problem.  
It involves creating a model that represents reality, and removing details that are not relevant to the problem.

### Problem Abstraction
Act of removing details until the problem is reduce to one which has already been solved.  
ie, idea that most problems are made up of many smaller problems, most of which have already been solved.  

## Modelling and Simulation
Irrelevant details, of the problem and reality, are abstracted from the problem and applied to a model. Then algorithms and data structures, that are designed for the model, are implemented into it.  
This is done to help solve a particular problem.

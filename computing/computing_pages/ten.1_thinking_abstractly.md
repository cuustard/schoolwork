# Thinking Abstractlly

Computationally Thinking: The ability to logically think about a problem mand apply techniques to solve it.  

## Thinking Abstractly
Abstraction involves devising a model that represets the reality and removing details that are not relevant to the problem.

## Modelling and Simulation

- building a model of reality
- model is abstracted for use of simulation
- algorithims and data structures can be designed for sim
- algorithm is then implemented into program and executed

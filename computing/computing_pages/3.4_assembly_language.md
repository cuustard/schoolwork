## Addressing Modes
The last 2 bits of the opcode specify the addressing mode. This specifieswhether th eoperand represents:

### Immediate Addressing
The operand holds an actual value

### Direct Addressing
Operand holds the address of the value

### Indirect Addressing
The operand is the location holding the address of the value

### Index Addressing
The address of the operand is obtained by adding a constant value to the contents of a feneralregister - called the index register).  
Used to access any array whose elements are in successive memory locations.  
By incrementing the value in the index register, siccessive memory locations can be accessed.

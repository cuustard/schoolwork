# Thinking Ahead

## Abstract models

Computational problems can be represented by a simple diagram.  
Input ---> Computational problem ---> Outout  
Input is the relevant information to the problem.
Output is the solution to the problem

## Thinking Ahead

Act of takining initial abstract model and adding detail until it has been transformed into a computer program.

##

Take inital abstracted model, and add detail until it is a program.  
There are 2 challanges in producing a solution to a computational problem:

-   Algorithm must be correct (work for all inputs)
-   Algorithm must be efficient

Advantage of documenting inputs and outputs is that there is no ambiguity in what the sub-process needs and what is returned

# Thinking Ahead

Take inital abstracted model, and add detail until it is a program.  
There are 2 challanges in producing a solution to a computational problem:
- Algorithm must be correct (work for all inputs)
- Algorithm must be efficient

Advantage of documenting inputs and outputs is that there is no ambiguity in what the sub-process needs and what is returned

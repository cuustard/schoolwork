# Programming Paradigms

## Programming Paradigms

- Procedural programming
- object-oriented programming
- declarative programming
- functional

## What is a paradigm
A style or way of programming  
Some languages only support one paradigm, others more.


## Imperative Programming
Series of instructions, deals with input

### Structured Programming
A kind of procedural (imperative) programming which uses selection, sequence nad iteration and recursion rather than goto statements.  
Modular techniques are used to split a large programs into manageable chunks.

## Declarative Programming
like SQL, statements describe the problem, then works out how to do it.

### Logic Programming
A form of decorative programming.  
A paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without expressing its control flow. ( you say what to do, and it says how)

### Bakctracking
Program can backtrack to the last decsision and try a different route until the goal is achieved

### Applications

- Medical
- Oil exploration
- Tax regulations
- processing natural language, english, russian, urdu, etc

## Object-oriented Programming
OOP languages were developed to make it possible to astact details of implementation away from the user.  
it is easy to design, reuse and easy to maintain.  
A program consists of objects:
- each object has its own data (attributes) and operations on that data (methods)
- objects interact with one naother
- all processing is done by objects

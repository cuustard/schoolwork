# Primitive Data Types, Binary, and Hexadecimal

## Primitive Data Types

A primitive Data type is one provided by a programming language.
They include:

-   int
-   real/float
-   bool
-   str
-   char

## Binary Representations & Number System

All data is held in binary. Therefore it's impossible to tell what a binary value represents, without knowing the data type.  
Binary uses only two digits: 0 & 1.

## Why use hex?

-   easier to read and remember
-   quicker to write or type
-   less chance of making error
-   to define colour, MAC addresses, assembly language, machine code
-   easy to convert to and from binary

# Primitive Data Types, Binary, and Hexadecimal

## Primitive Data Types

A primitive Data type is one provided by a programming language.
They include:

-   int
-   real
-   float
-   Boolean
-   string

All data types are held in binary. So without knowing the data type, it is impossible to tell the type what a binary represents.  
Binary is represented by 1's and 0's.

## Why use hex?

-   easier to read and remember
-   quicker to write or type
-   less chance of making error
-   to define colour, MAC addresses, assembly language, machine code
-   easy to convert to and from binary

# Binary Arithmetic

```
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 0 carry 1
1 + 0 = 1
```

```
0 + 0 + 0 = 0
0 + 0 + 1 = 1
0 + 1 + 1 = 0 carry 1
1 + 1 + 1 = 1 carry 1
1 + 1 + 0 = 0 carry 1
1 + 0 + 0 = 1
```

## Representing Negative Numbers

## Sign and Magnitude.

The first bit acts as the sign, 0 for + and 1 for -.  
Arithmetic does not work when using sign and magnitude.

## Two's complement

Turning back 1 from 00000000 is 11111111.

The two's complement of a signed binary value is found by flipping all the buts and adding 1.

For example:

-   Find -77<sub>10</sub> in two's complement.

-   find posotive value first (77): 01001101 == 77

-   Flip the bits: 10110010

-   Add 1: 10110011 == =77

Find 77 in two's complement.

find negative value first (-77):
10110011

Flip the bits:
01001100

Add 1:
01001101

### Range

-(2<sup>(n-1)</sup>) ... 2<sup>(n-1)</sup>-1

## Subtraction with two's complment

Can use two's complement to do addition with negative numbers.  
so 65 - 10 == 65 + -10

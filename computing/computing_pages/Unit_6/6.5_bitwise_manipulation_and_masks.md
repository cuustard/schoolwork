# Bitwise Manipulation and Masks

## Manipulating Bits

Manipulating induvidual bits in a byte is one of the advantages of assembly language.  
Bits can be manipulated in two ways:
- Using shift instructions to move bits left or right
- Using logical instructions NOT, AND, OR, and XOR with appropriate masks


## Logical Shifts

Can be used to examine the least significat bit of a number

### Right Shift

Causes the least significant bit to be shifted into the carry bit.

### Left Shift

Causes the most significant bit to be shifted into the carry bit

## Arithmetic Shifts

### Right Shift

Causes the least significant bit to be shifted into the carry bit.  
Instead of 

### Left Shift

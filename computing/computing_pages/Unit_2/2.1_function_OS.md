# 2.1 Purpose & Function of the Operating System

## What is an Operating System (OS)?

-   Is software used to manage communication between computer components
-   The OS is stored in ROM, and loaded into RAM when the computer is turned on
-   The OS manages the hardware and provides a UI for users and application software

### Functions of the OS:

-   User interface
-   Memory Management
-   Interrupt Handling
-   Processor scheduling

## User Interface

The OS provide the user with a UI to hide the complexity of the hardware.

## Memory Management

The OS manages the allocation of RAM to different programs.
There are 2 several techniques:

| Technique    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Paging       | <details>Free memory is divided into fixed sized chunks called pages<br>Each page has an address<br>A process loaded into RAM is allocated enough pages, but the pages may not be next to eachother physically</details> |
| Segmentation | <details>Memory is divided into segmentes which can be different lengths<br>The segments can relate to parts of a program</details>                                                                                     |

### Page Tables

Page tables map between the logical location and the physical memory location.

## Virtual Memory

Every Computer has a fixed amount of RAM. Secondary storage can be designated as virtual memory  
benefits:

-   Can load more programs

Drawbacks:

-   Takes up hard drive disk space
-   Runs down HDD lifespan (Disk trashing)

## Interrupts

An interrupt is a signal that forces the CPU to stop current tasks, and to do the interrupt.  
The CPU then continues to do the original tasks once the interrupt is done.  
It is necessary that the CPU can be interrupted and interrupts can be sent to the CPU by software, hardware, devices or the internal clock

### The Stack

When an interrupt is detected, the processor stops fetching instructions to push the current contents of its registers onto a stack  
The CPU uses an interrupt service routine to process the interrupt

### Interrupt Priorities

If a higher priority comes, while an interrupt is processing, the original interrupts registers will be pushed onto the stack as well  
A stack is a LIFO (Last in First out) data structure

## Processor Scheduling

-   1 CPU can process instructions for one app at a time
-   The OS must schedule when each app can use the CPU

### Aims of Scheduling

-   To give an acceptable response time to users
-   To maximise the time the CPU is usefully engaged
-   To ensure fairness on a multi-user system

### Scheduling Techniques:

| Technique                   | Description                                                                                                                              | Advantages                                                                                                                                      | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

  <p>Paging and Segmentation</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe the fist technique.</summary>
  <p>Paging is a technique that divides free memory into fixed sized chunks called pages, each with its own address. A process is allocated enough pages but pages may not be next to eahother.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe the second technique.</summary>
  <p>Segmentation is a technique that divides memory into segements which can be different lengths. Each segement can relate to parts of a program.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What do page tables do?</summary>
  <p>Page tables map the logical location and the physical memory location together.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe virtual memory.</summary>
  <p>Secondary storage can be used as virtual memory. This means that a system can laod more programs. However this also takes up secondary storage space and can reduce the lifespan of it (disk thrashing).</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is an interrupt?</summary>
  <p>An interrupt is a signal that forces the CPU to stop current tasks and to dothe interrupt instead.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe the purpose of the stack</summary>
  <p>When an interrupt is detected, the current instruction beingprocessed stops processing, and its current contents in the registers, onto a stack.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe how a stack handels interrupts of different prioritites.</summary>
  <p>If an higher interrupt, interrupts, then the contents of the interrupt being processed will be pushed to the stack. The stack is a LiFo (last-in, first-out) data structure</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the 3 aims of scheduling</summary>
  <p>To give an acceptable response time for users<br>To maximise the time the CPU is usefully engaged<br>To ensure fairness of a multi-user system.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe Round Robin and its advantages and disadvantages.</summary>
  <p>When using the round robin technique, each task is allocated a time slice by FiFo.<br>Round Robin is prefereable as it is simple to implement, starvation-free, and most efficient when tasks are similar in size and priority. However it does not take priority or length into account.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe First Come First Serve and its advantages and disadvantages.</summary>
  <p>When using the First Come First Serve technique, the firset job to arrive is executed first. This technique is preferable as it is simple to implement and ensures a process will run to completion in minial time. However, it does not take priority into account, is inefficient if tasks greatly vary in length and is not starvation-free.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe Shortest Remaining Time and its advantages and disadvantages.</summary>
  <p>The time for completion is estimated as teh job arrives. The job with the shortest remaining time is executed first. This technique is preferable as short processes are done very quickly and ensures the max number of processes are completed in agiven time. However, it does not take priority of a process into acount and long jobs may never be completed if shorter jobs keep jumping the queue.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe Shortest Job First and its advantages and disadvantages.</summary>
  <p>The total execution time is estimted by the user. The waiting job with smallest execution time is executed when the current job finishes. This technique is preferable as it ensures the number of jobs are completed, ensures short jobs arent kept waiting and minimises average time a process takes. However, it does not take priority into account. If a long job is nearly done, it will be interrupted and put at the back of the queue when a shorter job arrives. Furthermore, the estimated time for completion could be incorrect and long jobs may never complete if shorter jobs keep jumping the queue</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Describe thet Multi-level Feedback Queues and its advantages and disadvantages.</summary>
  <p>When using this technique, different priority levels are created. If a job uses too much CPU time, it is moved to a lower priority and vice versa. This technique is preferable as it takes priority into account so it ensures that higher priority processes run on time. However, it is complex to implement, not efficient if jobs have similar priority. Furthermore, low priority jobs may take longer to complete if the queue algorithm doesn't take wait time into account</p>

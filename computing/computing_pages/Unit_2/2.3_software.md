### Disk Defragmented

The process of moving parts of files to make each parts contiguous.  
This is needed as parts of files can be changed, moved, or deleted.

### Automatic Backup

Data needs to be backed up in case of hardware failure.  
The process can be automated.

### Automatic Updates

Runs in background detecting software update releases and then automatically installs them.

### Virus Checker

Scans storage for viruses and malware by comparing files to known viruses and malware.  
They use heuristics (characteristics of malicious program) to flag possible files as a virus.

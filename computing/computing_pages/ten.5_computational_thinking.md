# Computational Thinking

## Simulation problems
- Simulation is the process if designing a model ofa real sysstem to understand the behaviour of the system and to evaluate strats for its operation.  
applications:
- financial risk analysis
- amusement park rides
- population predictions
- managin invnetory systems
- queuing problems

## Enumeration Problems
Finding all the possible solutions.

## Routing Finding
Finding all possible paths from A to B.

## Queueing problems
A queueing system is described by:
- the arrival rate
- time between arrivals
- number of servers
- service time

## Strats for Algorithm design
- Divide and conquer is a very efficient strat

## Heuristic methods
includes rules of thumn. educated gueses, intuitive judgements, or common sense.  
teachers, students, psychologist, chess players, use heuristis to solve problems.  
  
DEF: enabling someone to discover or learn something for themself.  
  
Is used to rapidly find a solution that is good enough even though it might not be the optimal solution.  

### Applications
- routing messages accross the internet
- building circuit boards
- transportation
- virus checking
- DNA analysis
- artififical intelligence

## Data mining
the process of collecting and analysing data in huge amounts.  
many orgs such as NHS, police, Google, Amazon, and supermarkets collect billions of bytes of data about people.  
They can then analyse or 'mine' the data t ofind connections and associations.  
a range of modelling techniques are used to help to identify patterns in the data.

### Applications of mining
Increasing response rates to marketing campaigns - being able to target them more accurately to the needs of each customer.  
anticipating resource demands.  
Detecting fraud and cybersecurity issues.  
finding connections between seemingly unconnected......

### Big data
imples that huge amounts of data are collected and stored.  
defined by three major features known as the 3Vs:
- volume - volume of data that is collected is increasing
- variety - 
- velocity - volume we have, and then the speed at which we can process that.

Parallel coomputing is algorithm tasks are executed concurrently on a cluster of machies or supercomputers, is fundemental to managing big data tasks.  

### medical applications

# Computational Thinking

## Simulation problems
- Simulation is the process if designing a model ofa real sysstem to understand the behaviour of the system and to evaluate strats for its operation.  
applications:
- financial risk analysis
- amusement park rides
- population predictions
- managin invnetory systems
- queuing problems

## Enumeration Problems
Finding all the possible solutions.

## Routing Finding
Finding all possible paths from A to B.

## Queueing problems
A queueing system is described by:
- the arrival rate
- time between arrivals
- number of servers
- service time

## Strats for Algorithm design
- Divide and conquer is a very efficient strat

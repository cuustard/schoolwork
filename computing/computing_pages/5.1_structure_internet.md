# Structure of the Intnet

## The internet
The interent is a network of inter-connected networks.
It is a WAN (Wide-area-network). The biggest.  
WWW is a collection of resources accessed via the internet.  

## Directing Traffic
Main part of the internet is known as backbone.  
The backbone is a set of dedicated connections that connect several large networks at various points on the globe.  
Each of these points are then connected to other regional networks, usually controlled by thet internet Service providers (ISP).  

## Internet Addresses
Each device on a network needs to be uniquely id'd so data can be sent to the correct destination.
- like an address on a letter

### IP addressing

IPv4 addresses are made of four octet values (numbers described by 8 bits). separated by a full stop.  
this provides only 4.3 billion addresses
  
IPv6 addresses (128 bit). allows for more

## URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
URLs are used to specify the means of accessing a resource across a network and it's location.  
The protocol and domain name of the resource together form the URL

- http specifices that it is a web page
- www.___.co.uk/index.html specifies domain name
- these together specify URL: http://www.___.co.uk

## DNS (Domain Name Systems)
DNS servers are dedicated computers with an index of domain names and their IP addresses.  
A computer querie a DNS server for a domain name. if that is found, it will return the IP address that the computer can use to send a message to it.

## DNS server structure
There are 13 root DNS server that work together to catalogue every domain name.  
- these are segmented into geo groups or levels
- when the IP address of a given domain is unknown, it is refered to a related domain server that may know it.
they are normally resonsible for the top level domains

## Resolving an IP address
If a client has no cached record of an IP address for www.google.co.uk  
It sends a DNS query for that domain to it's specified DNS server  
If the DNS server does not have a record for it, then:  
either recursively handles the request so it can deliver an IP address  
or referes to a DNS server authoritative for example, .uk and follow this and subsequent referarals, to successively lower=level DNS servers

## Internet Registries
domains and IP's must be unique.  
There are 5 global Registries are responsible for allocating IP adresses to specific domain names.  
They work together to maintain a database of address assignments that ensure an IP and domain names are unique.

# 1.5 Output Devices
Output devices take data produced by a computer and turn it into human-readable form

## Printers
### Inkjet Printer
Most common form of printer.

#### Costs
Printers are sold below production cost. Ink is dramatically marked up above production cost.

### Laser Printers
Second most common form. They use dry ink called toner. They are fast and reliable. Print quality is excelent.

### Dot Matrix Printers
They are not common as they are outdated. They strike an inked ribbon whihc imprints dots to form letters.

### 3D Printers
Can print using  plastic filament, powdered resin, ceramic or metal powder or paper.

#### Applications of 3D printers
They can make prosthetic limbs or orthotics and can be used in reconstructive or general surgery.  
They can be used for manufactoring car parts.

#### Dangers of 3D printers
Printing weapons

## Radio Frequency ID (RFID)
RFID system are I/O devices.  
They use a transponder and a reciever.

### Uses of RFID
- Security control points or identification of people, animals or goods.  
- Shipping and supply of chain tracking for goods
- banking and fast payment
- replacement for barcode systems

#### Passive and Active tags
Passive transponders have no power source so rely on radio waves from the reciever for their energy.  
Active tags use a larager, battery poweredbeacon which can broadcast it's own signal to recievers up to 300m away.

## Actuators
Motors used in conjunction to sensors to control mechanisms.  
eg:
- valve or door
- starting a pump
- turning a fan

## Loudspeakers & Headphones
Digital data is sent from the computer to a digital to analogue converter where it is converted into an analogue signal. The signal is then sent to an amplifier and then sent to a speaker

## Monitors
### LCD Monitors
Each pixel contains a red green and blue diode.

### LED vs CCFLs
LED:
- brighter and faster brightness
- sharper, realisticer, vivider
- thinner screens
- more reliable
- consume little power, so produce little heat so smalelr cost

### Organic LED Screen
OLED are thinner and brighter

#### Benefits of OLED
- no back lighting
- less power consumed
- little heat produced
- larger fov (especially when curved)

## Multimedia Light Projectors
Takes video signal, coverts into a viewable image and projects onto screen.

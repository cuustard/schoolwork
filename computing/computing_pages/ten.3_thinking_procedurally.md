# THinking Procedurally

## Structured Programming
Is a method of writing a program that uses:
- Modularization - for program structure and organisation. Breadking down a problem into subroutines.  
Procedures and functions. (functions return a value)
- Structured Code - for the individual modules (sequence, selection and iteration)
- Recursion
It aims to improve clarity and quality of a program

### Benefits of modularaisation

- easily and quickly written
- large programs broken down into subtasks - easier to manage
- modules can be re-used several times in a program
- frequently used modules can be saved in a library and used by other programs
- several programmers can simultaniously work on different modules.

## Hierarchy Chart
each logical process is broken down into smalller components until it cannot be broken down any further.  
execution takes place from left to right.

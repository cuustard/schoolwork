## Relational Operators

| Relational Operator |                          |
| :------------------ | :----------------------- |
| >                   | greater than             |
| <                   | less than                |
| =>                  | greater than or equal to |
| =<                  | less than or equal to    |
| ==                  | equal to                 |
| !=                  | not equal to             |

## Complex Boolean Expressions

| Operator | Description                                       |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| AND      | Returns TRUE if both conditions are true          |
| OR       | Returns TRUE if either of the conditions are true |
| NOT      | Returns opposite of condition                     |

## switch/case

logical equivalent of the , if then else endif.  
It is used to make it easier to code multiple condition checks.

```
switch choice
case a: print("you chose a")
case b: print("you chose b")
case c: print("you chose c")
endswitch
```

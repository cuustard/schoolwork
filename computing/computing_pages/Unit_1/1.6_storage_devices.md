## RAM & ROM

|            | RAM                                   | ROM              |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------- |
| Stands for | Random Access Memory                  | Read Only Memory |
| Stores     | OS, running programs, data being used | BIOS             |
| Volatile   | Yes                                   | No               |
| Read/Write | Read & write                          | Read             |

## Virtual Memory

Virtual memory is part of the hard drive used as an extension to RAM.

## Primary and Secondary Storage

Primary storage is volatile. E.G. RAM.  
Secondary storage refers to non-volatile storage. E.G.:

-   Magnetic storage such as the hard disk
-   Optical storage that uses laser light such as CD-ROM
-   Solid-state devices using flash memory

## Secondary Storage Devices

Factors of Secondary Storage Devices:

-   Durability
-   Read/write speed
-   Capacity
-   Portability
-   Cost

### Hard Disk

Consists of tracks, sectors, and platters.

-   Concentric tracks are created on a magnetic disk.
-   Disk spins at high speed: 3,600 – 7,200 RPM.
-   Spinning platters are each read by drive heads.
-   Data is read or written as the sector moves under the head.

Hard disks have very high capacity. They have fast read and write speeds and are relatively cheap storage per TB.

### Solid State Drives

Solid-state media commonly uses electrically programmable non-volatile flash memory.

Advantages and disadvantages of solid-state media:

-   More durable
-   SSD cards have no moving parts, so they can survive drops, extreme heat and cold, and extreme pressure.
-   Typically less capacity than a hard disk.
-   Faster than hard disk drives.
-   Consume less power.
-   More portable.
-   More expensive than hard disk drives.

### USB Flash Drives

Store up to 128 GB of data; that’s 2,500 photos. Prices start at under £5.00. Can use password protection. They are useful for transferring data between computers.

### CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray

The capacities of these discs differe because different laser wavelengths 'burn' differently sized pits. This means that the spiral track can be differently wound, creating different lengthed tracks.
Why are the capacities of these discs different given they are all the same physical size?

#### Optical Disk Formats

Optical disks are available as:

-   Read only
-   Recordable
-   Re-writable formats

Optical disks are often best suited for software mailing. This is because they're cheap to manufacture and distribute. Robust and lightweight during carriage.

#### CD Formats

CDs come in three different formats:

-   CD-ROM (Read only)
-   CD-R (Recordable)
-   CD-RW (Rewritable)

CD-ROM is “pressed” at the time of manufacture.  
CD-R can be written to once.  
CD-RW can be written, read many times, erased, and written again.

#### Uses for Optical Disks

-   CD-ROM is widely used for software distribution.
-   CD-R may be used for copying a game, software, audio, or video files or documents. These can then easily be stored offline.
-   CD-RW useful for short- or medium-term backup or transferring files from one computer to another.
-   DVD and Blu-ray are high-capacity discs which can store feature-length films.

## Capacity and Access Speed

| Media            | Capacity     | Access Speed |
| :--------------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| Hard Disk        | 0.5-6 TB     | Fast         |
| CD-ROM           | 700 MB       | Medium       |
| DVD              | 5-9 GB       | Medium       |
| Blu-ray Disk     | 25-50 GB     | Medium       |
| Solid State Disk | 0.004 - 2 TB | Very Fast    |

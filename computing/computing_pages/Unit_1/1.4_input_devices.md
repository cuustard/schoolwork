# 1.4 Input Devices

## Manual Input Devices

All input devices transfer data from the source to the computer.  
Some require human interaction to generate data.  
For example:

-   Keyboards
-   Pointing devices
-   Mics
-   Touchscreens
-   Interactive whiteboards

### Interactive Whiteboards

Used to display computer output.
Allow the user to interact with the computer output, directly on the screen.

## Barcode Readers

They can represent letters and/or numbers.

Used in:

-   Retail
-   Warehousing
-   Transport
-   Shipment tracking.

## QR (Quick Response) Codes

Directs to websites and information.  
Can be read by smartphones and tablets.

Barcodes uses can include:

-   Restaurant coupons
-   Mobile concert tickets
-   Real estate agency boards
-   Business cards
-   Tourist info
-   Adverts

## 2D Scanners

Used to convert paper copy into a computer-readable format.  
Useful digitising hand-drawn images or writing.

## 3D face recognition

Used by security cameras.  
Software measures and compares proportions of a face with those pre-known.  
Security applications.

## 3D Scanners

Used in industrial and medical fields.  
Done by tomography. This is the process of imagine something in very thin slices.  
Such as MRI scans

## Sensor

A device that can take analogue measurements of physical properties.  
Analogue data is that which has no discrete value, so data changes smoothly rather than in incremental jumps.  
This data must be converted into a digital form for computers to understand.

Types of sensor:

| Sensor         | Uses                                                          |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Gas            | monitor C0<sub>2</sub>/0<sub>2</sub> levels in an environment |
| Infra-red      | Detection of home intruders                                   |
| Light          | Street lights turning on when it gets dark                    |
| Temperature    | control heating in house                                      |
| Pressure       | checking weight of vehical on bridge                          |
| pH             | monitor pH levels in soil                                     |
| Magnetic Field | used in vehicals anti-lock braking systems                    |
| Moisture       | control dampness of air in greenhouse                         |
| Acoustic       | detection of sound in burglar alarm system                    |

## Monitoring and Control

| Term       | Description                                                                                    |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Monitoring | When the device recieving input does not make changes to the input process                     |
| Control    | When the output alters how the process operates, therefore chaning the ouput of the next input |

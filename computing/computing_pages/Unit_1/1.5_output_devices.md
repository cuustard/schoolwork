# 1.5 Output Devices

Output devices take data produced by a computer and turn it into human-readable format.

## Printers

| Printer    | Desc                                                                                                                                                        |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inkjet     | Most common form                                                                                                                                            |
| Laser      | Second most common form. Uses dry ink called toner. Fast and reliable with excellent print quality                                                          |
| Dot Matrix | Outdated. Strikes an inked ribbon which imprints dots to form characters                                                                                    |
| 3D         | Prints with plastic, resin, ceramic, metal, paper. Used to make prosthetic limbs, orthotics, reconstructive or general surgery, and unfortunately: weapons. |

## Radio Frequency ID (RFID)

RFID system are I/O devices.  
They use a transponder and a receiver.
They have several uses:

-   Identification of people, animals or goods.
-   Shipping and supply of chain tracking for goods
-   Banking and fast-payment systems
-   Replacement for barcode systems

They use tags:

| Tags    | Description                                                                        |
| :------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Passive | no power source so rely on radio waves from a receiver for energy                  |
| Active  | battery powered beacon that broadcasts its own signal to receivers up to 300m away |

## Actuators

An actuator is a motor used in conjunction to sensors, to control mechanisms. For example, opening a value or door, starting a pump, turning a fan.

## Loudspeakers & Headphones

Digital data sent from the device to a DAC (Digital to Analogue Converter) for conversion.
The converted signal is then boosted using an amplifier and then sent to a speaker.

## Monitors

### LCD Monitors

-   LCD screens use red, green, and blue diodes for pixels.
-   Backlit by Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamps (CCFL) or LEDs.

### LEDs vs. CCFLs

LEDs are better than CCFLs because:

-   Immediate maximum brightness.
-   Produce sharper, more vivid images.
-   Allow for thinner screens.
-   Longer lifespan and lower power consumption.

#### Organic LED (OLED) Screens

-   Thin, lightweight, and flexible.
-   Emit brighter light compared to LCD/LED.

#### Benefits of OLED

-   Self-illuminating, no need for backlighting.
-   Ideal for battery-operated devices.
-   Minimal heat generation, reducing fire risk.
-   Wider viewing angle, enhanced with curved screens.

## Multimedia Light Projectors

Compact, high-res, colour projectors are used for projecting a device's screen.  
It does this by taking a video signal, converting it into a viewable image and projecting it.  
They may be used for presenting presentations, or videos.

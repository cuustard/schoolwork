## Djikstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

This algorithm finds the shortest path between a start node and every other node - in a weighted algorithm. The weights between nodes can represent many things. For exanple, distance, time, or cost of travel.

This algorithm can be used in circuit board design, route planning, games strategy, and project management.

# Analysis & Design of Algorithms

Unsolvable problem: no algorithm can be written to find the solution.  
Undecidable problem: no algorithm can be written to always give a correct true/false decision for every input value

## Problems solved by Algorithms

-   Routing - packets, shortest traveling route
-   Timetabling - aircraft, schools
-   Searching - information on the internet
-   Encrypting - communications so they aren't hacked
-   Sorting - large amounts of data
-   Writing - compiler

## Properties of a good algorithm

-   clear and precise steps
-   produce correct output for any set of values
-   most (must always terminate)
-   should execute efficiently, in as few steps as possible
-   designed so others easily understand

## Efficiency of an Algorithm

Can measure the efficiency of an algorithm by the number of assignment statements carried out during the execution of the algorithm. For example, in the following algorithm the number of assignment statements is 1002:

```
n = 1000
sum = 0
for couny = 1 to n
  sum = sum + count
next count
```

In the next algorithm, there are only 2 statements:

```
n = 1000
sum = n * (n + 1) / 2
```

In general, the larger the size of the problem or amount of data, the longer the execution time.

## Functions

Below Tables shows the mathematical form of functions, and each functions Order of magnitude O()

| Type        | Form                    | Order of magnitude |
| :---------- | :---------------------- | :----------------- |
| Linear      | an + b                  | O(n)               |
| Quadratic   | an<sup>2</sup> + bn + c | O(n<sup>2</sup>)   |
| Logarithmic | alog(<sub>2</sub>n)     | O(log(n))          |

## Big-O notation

A measure of the time complexity of an algorithm. It is used to find an approximation of the time it takes to execute an algorithm for a given number of items in a data set.

## Permutations

The number of ways the n items can be arranged.

| Type                   | E.g.                                                                |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Repetition allowed     | combination lock with 4 digits 0 to 9                               |
| Repetition not allowed | 4 differently colored balls in a bag and you draw out one at a time |

### With Repetition

Imagine a 2 combination lock with 0 to 9 (10 options). The first digit could be any of 0 to 9. For each of those options, the second could also be any digit between 0 and 9.  
This can be described as time complexity O(10<sup>n</sup>).

### Without Repetition

Imagine a bag with 2 coloured balls: 1 red, 1 blue, 1 green. You can pick one out at a time. When picking the first out, there are 3 possibilities. When picking out the second ball, there are 2 posibilities. When picking out the last, there is 1. This can be expressed as 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 combinations of picking out the 3 balls.  
This can be described as time complexity O(n!)

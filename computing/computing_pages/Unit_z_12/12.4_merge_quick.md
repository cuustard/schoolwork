# Merge & Quick Sort

## Merge Sort

Quicker than bubble sort.  
Split list of items into lists of a singular item. Merge them back in order.  

The time complexity:
O(nlog(n))

## Quick Sort

Quickest.

Worked example:

1. Determine a split point in order to divide the list into 2 halves; 1 half being less than the split point, the other half being larger than.
2. Choose a value to be the pivot value. Normally the first value in the list.
3. Divide the list into two partisions: items < pivot, and all items < pivot
4. Now the pivot is at the correct place.
5. Repeate this process with each new partitioned list.

O(nlog(n))

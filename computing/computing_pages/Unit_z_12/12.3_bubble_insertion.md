# Bubble, Insertion, Merge, & Quick Sort

## Choosing A Sorting Algorithm

The Bubble Sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm. But if there are only a small number of items to sort, it is adequate.  
However it can take a lot of memory, which can be a problem with large data sets.

## The Bubble Sort

To sort an array of n items, n-1 passes are made through the array. With each item being compared with the adjacent item, and being swapped if necessary.  
Pseudocode algorithm:

```
for i = 0 to n - 2
    for j = 0 to (n - i - 2)
        if a[j] > a[j + 1]
            swap the items
        endif
    next j
next i
```

The algorithm has a nested loop so the time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>)

## Insertion Sort

An efficient algorithm for sorting a short array of items.

Pseudocode algorithm:

```
procedure insertionSort(aList)
    for j = 1 to len(aList) - 1
        nextItem = aList[j]
        i = j â€“ 1
        while i >= 0 and aList[i] > nextItem
            aList[i + 1] = aList[i]
            i = i - 1
        endwhile
        aList[i + 1] = nextItem
    next j
endprocedure
```

The algorithm has a nested loop so the time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>)

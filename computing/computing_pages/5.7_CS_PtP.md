# Client Server and Peer to Peer

A network model consists of the client and server.  
The client accesses data from the server.

## Client-server features

-   A central server - to manage security, store files, and process tasks
-   Client issue requests to the server for services such as email, file storage, backup and printing
-   suitable for organisation
-   Can require specialist IT staff to administer the network

## Peer-to-peer

Has no central server

-   suitabel for small company or at home
-   no central srever controls files or security
-   all comps can communicate without server
-   if comp turend off, cannot retrieve data from it

## Vs

| Client-server                                               | Peer-to-peer                                      |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| User Id's, passwords and access levels centrally controlled | Files and programs stored on individual computers |
| Used in small to large organizations                        |                                                   | Can be expensive to set up and to manage | suitable for a home pc network |
| Backup is centralised and usually automated                 | each pc can act as client and server              |
| No access to other users files                              | used for sharing music and streaming live events  |

### Client Processing

Data is processed before it is sent to a server by the lient

#### Client Processing JS

JS used to validate data before sent to server for further validation

| quick execution as no coms with the server is required                                    | scripts are processed by the client, they are dependent on the performance of client machine                                      |
| removes potentially unnecessary processing from the server                                | different browsers process scripts in slightly different ways, so web devs cannot be ertain how end-product will look to the user |
| data can not be intercepted on the way to the server, increasing secuirty for the server. |                                                                                                                                   |

## Application Programming Interface

An API is a set of tools that can be used for building software applications

-   API requests are processed by the client and responded to by the server.
    For example:
    `<script src="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js"></script>`
    This line of codes allows a web page to make use of the google maps facility

## Server Side Processing

needed to:

-   process user input as another lsyer of validation
-   display pages
-   structure web apps
-   interact with databases

programming languages use:

-   PHP
-   Python
-   ASP

Client may not be able to provide the data needed to process a request.  
A company may hold sensetive data relating to the request.  
The way data is proccessed may also be lawfully protected.

A server may also validate data submitted by a client as JS can easily be circumvented.  
This makes server side validation crucial.

| Client Processing  | Server Processing                      |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| web page behaviour | Item stock level lookup                |
| Styling            | Loading product info from the database |
| form vaildation    | sending request back to the client     |

# Boolean Algebra

## Logic Gates

Take one or more inputs and produces a single output.  
Four gates:

-   NOT
-   AND
-   OR
-   XOR

### NOT

Boolean algebra: P = NOT A  
Boolean notation: P = ¬A

### AND

Boolean algebra: P = A AND B  
Boolean notation: P = A ︿ B

### OR

Boolean algebra: P = A or B
Boolean notation: P = A ﹀ B

### XOR

If only one of the inputs is 1, then output is 1. Otherwise output is 0.

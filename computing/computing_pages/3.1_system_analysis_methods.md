# System Analysis methods

## Software Development
Follows cyclic stages:
- Analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Evaluation
- Maintenance

### Analysis
A system analysis gathers information about:
- what the current system (if there is one) does
- what needs changing

To do this they may:
- interview customers
- use questionaores
- gather the clients requirements
- clients customers (users of the software)
- look at existing software

#### Output from Analysis
The system analysis will produce a dpcument called a "System Spec" or "User Requirements".  
This defines what teh system will do.  
It iis ued to create the disign and evaluate the finished product.

### Design
Design includes:
- A description of data: data type, format, validations
- database design
- input screens
- output screens and reports
- how the data will be processed
- how the software will be tested

### Implementation
- coding and testing the software
- writing user and technical documents
- installing the software for the user

#### Testing
##### Black Box
Carried out independantly of the code used in the program.  
Looks at the program spec and creates a set of test data that covers all the inputs, outputs and functions.

##### White Box
Depends on code logic.  
Tests are devised which test each path through the code at least once

#### Alpha Testing
Carried out by the software developer's team and the user.  
Reveals errors or omissions in the definition of systems requirements.  
Allows the user to discover that they want it to do.  
(Testing own product)

#### Beta Testing
Used when commercial software is being developed.  
Software given to a number of potential users who agree to send report of fualts.
(users testing product)

### Evaluation
The user now tests every aspect of the software to make sure it does what is should.  
It is checked against the original spec doc.

### Maintenance
#### Corrective
Bugs will be found when the software is put into action.

#### Adaptive
User requirements will change and the software will adapt to meet needs.

#### Perfective
There may be ways of making the software better, faster, easier to use, more functionality.

## The Waterfall Model
As each stage is completed, it is documented. Customer does not see the end result. Any change made often means the project has to be started again.  
When to use the waterfall model:
- requirements are very clear and fixed
- no ambigious requirements
- tech is well understood
- project is short

## Spiral Model
The stages are repeatedly completed. Each time all 4 are completed, a prototype is made. This means that each prototype can be refined from the previous.  
When to use the spiral model:
- For medium to high-rish projects
- when uses are unsure of their needs and what the possiblilites are
- when the requirements are complex
- for large projects that may take years to develope.

## The Agile Model
Softwaare is developed in rapid incremental cycles. Each version buils on previous functionality and each is thoroughly tested before release.
When to use the agile model:
- when new changes need to be implemented
- in an expanding or developing business where users needs are continuosly changing and developing

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Models
|model|advantages|disadvantages|
|:----|:---------|:------------|
|Waterfall| Simple to understand<br>each stage is well defined<br>so project is straightforward to manage<br>works best for smaller projects| Not much user involvement after the analysis stage<br>no working software released until late into the cycle<br>once finished, it is too late to make changes|
|Spiral| Well-defined steps<br>product produced at early stage so can be tested<br>User gives feedback on each prototype<br>functionality can be added during the process<br>End result is more likely to be what the used wanted| The process is time-consuming<br>System is more costly to develope because of time<br>not suitable for smaller products|
|Agile| Good for small projects<br>rapid delivery leads to customer satisfaction<br>customers devs and tested constantly interact<br>software is delivered frequently<br>software easily adapted<br>even late changes in requirements can be implemented| Lack of emphasis on design and documentation,<br>project can fail to deliver if the customer is not clear about the desired final outcome<br>not suitable for novice programmers| 

### Extreme Programming
a type of softwar dev. Frequent releases of software are made in short cycles. Intended to improve productivity and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.

## Large Projects
if projects take a long time, personnel change, requirements change, tech changes, costs change so the project could get cannceled.

## Rapid Application Dev
workshops and gocus groups gather requiremetns rather than official documents. Prototyping used to continually refine the system in response to user feedbaka. Each part of the system is producedwithin a strict time limit. Software components are reused wheneve possible.

# Relational Databases & Normalisation

## Relational Database Design

A row represents a record/instance.
Columns represents attributes.
A table should hold data about 1 entity.  

Tables can have 1 of 3 different relationships:

- One-to-one
- One-to-many
- Many-to-many

## Normalisation

A 3-stage process used to come with the best possible design for a database by reducing data duplication resulting in improved data integrity.

Advantages:
-   easier to maintain and change a normalised database
-   no unnecessary duplication of data
-   maintains data integrity
-   searches are faster because of small tables with fewer fields

A dependency is a value that varies in line with another value.

### First Normal Form (1NF)

A table is in 1NF if:

-   it contains no repeating attributes or groups of attributes
-   all attributes are atomic (1 attribute can not consist of two data items)

If a table is in a many-to-many relationship with another, a third table is needed to link them. This then removes the many-to-many.

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

A table is in 2NF if it:

-   is already in 1NF
-   contains no partial dependencies

A table contains partial dependencies if the table has a composite key.

### Third Normal Form (3NF)

A table is in 3NF if it:

-   is already in 2NF
-   contains no non-key dependencies

In other words, **all** attributes are dependent on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.

# Relational Databases & Normalisation

## Normalisation

A 3-stage process used to come with the best possible design for a database by reducing data duplication resulting in improved data integrity.

### Advantages

-   easier to maintain and change a normalised database
-   no unnecessary duplication of data
-   maintains data integrity
-   searches are faster because of small tables with fewer fields

### Dependencies

A dependency is a value that varies in line with another value.

## First Normal Form (1NF)

A table is in 1NF if:

-   it contains no repeating attributes or groups of data
-   all attributes are atomic

## Second Normal Form (2NF)

A table is in 2NF if it:

-   is already in 1NF
-   contains no partial dependencies

A table contains partial dependencies if the table has a composite key.

## Third Normal Form (3NF)

A table is in 3NF if it:

-   is already in 2NF
-   contains no non-key dependencies

In other words, **all** attributes are dependent on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.

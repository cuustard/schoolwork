# Introduction to SQL

SQL is a declarative language used to create, querying, and update tables in a relational database.

## Query Syntax

A querying is formatted as shown below:

```
SELECT ...
FROM ...
WHERE ...
ORDER BY ...
```

---

`SELECT` is used to return specific attributes (columns).

---

`FROM` is used to specify the table(s) that you'd like to extract data from.

---

`WHERE` is used to specify criteria that field values must meet for the record to be returned.

---

`ORDER BY` returns the results the results of a query in ascending or descending order.  
You must specify the attribute to order by, and then `ASC` or `DESC`. If the order by sequence is not specified, then `ASC` is used as defualt.

Let's pretend that we have the following Table in a database:

**Table Users**

| UserID | Username | Email                           | dateJoined | Subject          |
| :----- | :------- | :------------------------------ | :--------- | :--------------- |
| 1      | cuustard | 17evansj@willink.w-berks.sch.uk | 05/04/2017 | Computer Science |
| 2      | isaacken | 21isaack@gmail.com              | 23/11/2021 | Maths            |
| 3      | tom      | twilderspin6@gmail.com          | 30/07/2023 | Maths            |
| 4      | keya     | keyap7@outlook.com              | 27/06/2023 | Digital Media    |
| 5      | ioana    | ioanac@gmail.com                | 01/05/2023 | Maths            |
| 6      | clayton  |                                 |            |                  |
| 7      | ela      |                                 |            |                  |

We want to write query to return the Username, Email, and Subject from TableUsers, who's subject is Maths and joined between 2022 and 2023:

````
SELECT Username, Subject
FROM TableUsers
WHERE
```
````

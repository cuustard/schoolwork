# 1.4 Input Devices

## Manual Input Devices

All input devices transfere data from the source to the computer. Some input devices require human interventionto genetare data.
eg:

- keyboards
- pointing devices
- mics
- touchscreens
- interactive whiteboards

### Interactive Whiteboards

Interactive Whiteboards are used to dispaly computer output, to an audience.  
They allow the user to interact with the computer output, directly on the screen.

## Barcode Readers

Barcode readers can be used in retail, warehousing, transport, and shipment tracking.
They can represent letters and/or numbers.

## QR (Quick Response) Codes

Can be read by smartphones and tablets.  
Direct to websites and information.

Barcodes uses can include:

- restaurant coupons
- mobile concert ticketse
- real estate agency boards
- buisness cards
- tourist info
- adverts

## 2D Scanners

Used to convert paper copy into a computer-readable format.  
Usefull digitising hand-drawn images or writing.

## 3D face recongnition

Used by security cameras.  
software measures and compares proportions of a face with those pre-known.  
Security applications.

## 3D Scanners

Used in industrial and medical fields.  
Done by tomography. This is the process of imagine something in very thin slices.  
Such as MRI scans

## Sensor

A sensor is a device that can take analogue measurments of physical properties.  
Analogue means that the data has no discrete value so data changes smoothly rather than in inremental jumps.
This data must be converted into a digital form for computers to understand.

Types of sensor:

| Sensor         | Uses                                                          |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Gas            | monitor C0<sub>2</sub>/0<sub>2</sub> levels in an environment |
| Infra-red      | Detection of home intruders                                   |
| Light          | Street lights turning on when it gets dark                    |
| Temperature    | control heating in house                                      |
| Pressure       | checking weight of vehical on bridge                          |
| pH             | monitor pH levels in soil                                     |
| Magnetic Field | used in vehicals anti-lock braking systems                    |
| Moisture       | control dampness of air in greenhouse                         |
| Acoustic       | detection of sound in burglar alarm system                    |

## Monitoring and Control

| Term       | Description                                                                                    |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Monitoring | When the device recieving input does not make changes to the input process                     |
| Control    | When the output alters how the process operates, therefore chaning the ouput of the next input |

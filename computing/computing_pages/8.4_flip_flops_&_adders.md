# D-type flip-flops, adders and half-adders

## Half-adder

Performs addition of 2 bits.  
Takes 2 bits and outputs resut and carry.

## Full-adder

Combines 2 half adders.  Has 3 inputs (A, B and Cin), 2 outputs (S and Cout).  

## Edge-triggered D-type flip flops

A flip-flop is an elemental sequential logic circuit that can store one but and flip betwwen o and 1.  
A D-type has one input called D and two outputs Q and NOT Q.

### The Clock
Another sequential circuit that changes state at regular time intervals.  
A clock is needed to synchronise the change of state of flip flop circuits.  
The Edge-triggered D-type flip flop only changes on the rising edge of the clock signal.

### D-type flip flop as a memory unit


### Uses
- creating registers and counteres
- intermediate storage needed during arithmetic operations
- static RAM is also created using D-type flip-flops

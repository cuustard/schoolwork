# Representation of Gender in Advertising

Representation is how the media controls (mediates) the view of a person, group of people, or idea, to the audience.  

## How gender is represented in advertising

women - angel, desirable, white clothing, pure, elegant.

women - powerful

women - long hair, makeup, smooth skin, stereotype

men - command angles to fall from haven with product.

male gaze - blind man stare at angel





focus on women legs. legs look shaved, oily, clean.


Discourse - We get idea about gender from the media. therefore the representation of gender in the media is very important.


## Question why stereotypes are used in advertising

Stereotypes get representations accross to the audience quickly. This is done because adverts are short or static.

who is target audience?
what message does producer want to get accross?
what wider representations or ideologies about gender might this support?
how far is this stereotypical? why?

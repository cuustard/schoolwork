PowerPoint Presentation Design Principle

Certainly, here's the information in a markdown table format:

| Principle               | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One Message per Slide   | Each slide should convey a single clear message. Avoid overloading your slides with multiple messages, as it can confuse and overwhelm the audience.                                    |
| Use Contrast and Size   | Use contrast and size to control the audience's focus. Contrasting elements and larger objects naturally draw attention. Make sure the most important information stands out.           |
| Avoid Text-Heavy Slides | Minimize the amount of text on your slides, especially if you're speaking at the same time. Text-heavy slides can overwhelm the audience and lead to reduced retention of information.  |
| Background Color        | Consider using a dark background color instead of a white one. A dark background can reduce strain on the audience's eyes and help focus attention on the content.                      |
| Limit Objects           | Limit the number of objects on each slide to a maximum of six. More objects on a slide can require significantly more cognitive resources to process, leading to reduced comprehension. |

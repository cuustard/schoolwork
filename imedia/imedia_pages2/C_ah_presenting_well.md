PowerPoint Presentation Design Principle

| Thing             | Desc                                                                |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Messages          | 1 Message Per slide                                                 |
| Redundancy Effect | Talking over big text == not good. Small text and narrating == good |
| Size              | The greater the importance of text, the greater the size of it      |
| Contrast          | Transition contrast of certain text to highlight it as narrating    |
| Objects           | seeing > counting objects. So less objects per slide is better      |

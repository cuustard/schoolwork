# Representation
Representation is the way in which different aspects in society are presented by the media to the audience.  
How the media <span style="color: orange">construct</span> their texts to evoke a specific impression or reaction from the audience.  
It is the combination of <span style="color: yellow">media language</span> choices that construct the representation.  
Everything we see in the media is a representation because the media affect or '<span style="color: purple">mediate</span>' everything we see.

Media is mostly made by men, for men. This means that:

Archetypes are stereotypes that are extreme.  
Countertypes oppose the traditional stereotypes.
  
Intertextuality is a media text reffering to another text.

# Horror FIlms: Creating and reflecting fear

Codes and conventions I associate with horror genre:
- dark
- monsters
- murdurers
- blood
- jump scares
- tension
- good sound effects
- supernatural
- plot-twists
- creepy characters
- traumatic backstories

Horror offers a visceral feeling of excitement as well as fear. Both of which causes the production of adrenaline. Furthermore the genre offers intellectual pleasrues such as the problem-solving attributes that horror movies offer.

The older vampires adopt more animalistic monster traits whereas more modern vampires adopt more human sophisticated traits such as their more human appearence and their mannerism.  
I think the vampire has changed over time due to the lack of sophistocated monsters. Mordern vampires can be considered more scary as they look more like ordinary people. This creates a sense of unkown fear in the audience towards ordinary people.

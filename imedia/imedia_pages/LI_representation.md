# Love Island and Representation

## Liesbet Van Zoonen's Feminist Representation Theory

- gender is constructed through discource and gender varies through culture
- therefore the idea that women areobjects isa core element of western patriarchal culture
- idea that in mainstream culture the visual codes that construct the male body as spectacle differ from those used to objectify the female.

In a nutshell, men and women are represented differently in the meida.

## Judith Butler's Representation Theory
- gender is a performance (use characteristics, traits etc to 'perform' to be a certain way)
- idea that there are no gender identities behind gender
- The idea that performativity is not a singular act, but it's repetition and a ritual

# Mise-en-scene

Mise-en-scene describes everything that the audience can see in the frame and that everything is there for a reason.  
This includes:

- Props & Setting
- Costume & Make-up
- Facial Expression and Body Language
- Lighting & Colour
- Positioning

## Props & Setting

Props are any objects used or held by an actor to develope the storyline.  
Setting is where the action is set. This can be built from scratch or a location set.

Verisimilitude is how the scene is made realistic to the media text.  
Iconography is the representitive of a genre. For example, a cowboy hat instantly tells us that it is a western film.

## Costume & Make-up

Costumes and make-up can tells us the time period, social class, society type and culture.

## Facial Expressions

Facial expressions and body language indica\tes how a character is feeling in a scene.

## Lighting & Colour

### 3 Point lighting

| Light | Description                                                                           | Placement                                                     |
| :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Key   | Brightest light and gives the scene its overall exposure                              | Slightly off the side of the camera, facing the subject       |
| Fill  | Fills in the shadows created by the key light<br>bringing out the details in the dark | Slightly off the other side of the camera, facing the subject |
| Back  | Seperates subject from the foreground to create a sense of depth                      | Directly opposite the key/fill light, behind the subject      |

Key Light can be either high or low key.  
High key lighting makes the scene more realistic and natural.  
Low Key lighting makes the scene more dark, gloomy and forboding.  
Bottom or Side lighting makes the subject more dangerous or evil.  
Front or Back lighting makes the subject more innocent or good.

## Positioning

Relates to the positioning of elements and subjects in the frame (camera shots, angles and movement)

## Mise-en-scene Textual Analysis of a clip

verisimilitude is how real the world of the story or narrative of a fiction media product apperas to the audience.

diegetic world - fictional world (time and place) of the narrative

# Homework

The settings & props make this clip's verisimilitude realistic. This is shown by the electronic devices, such as computers, printers, phones, watches, etc. Electronic devices were not massively consumed by enforcement agencies until the late 20th, and the 21st century. This enforces the realism of the clip.

The costume, hair & make-up also enforce the clips verisimilitude. This is shown by the clothing (suits, high-vis vests, etc.)and the make-up (make-up was not worn by many people, especially mass-produced for people in the past). This shows that the time period and era do match up with the genre and therefore enforce the verisimilitude.

The body language aids in verisimilitude. This is shown by the fact that the protagonist's facial expression and body language shows him being concerned, rushed, sneaky and tense. Therefore, this shows that the character matches the genre of the film.

The lighting and colour partly aid in the verisimilitude of this clip. This is shown by the artificially made, artificial lighting used for the electric lights in the police station. They use more low-key lighting to create a dark, suspicious sense. Therefore, this matches the genre and reinforces the verisimilitude.

The positioning does not aid in the verisimilitude but does make the clip realistic. This is shown by the way the protagonist was moving, sneakily, hiding, walking slowly, and following. This does not aid in verisimilitude as these actions can be found in any genre, time period and social class, but this does make the scene realistic to the story.

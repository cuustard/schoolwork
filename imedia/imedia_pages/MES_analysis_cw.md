| Point                                                      | Example from text using mise-en-scene                                                              | Explanation                                                                                                                                    |

| This is a realistic clip                                   | Settings & Props:<br>Police station<br>fire alarm<br>led lights<br>lock & key<br>electronic devies | Police stations had electronic devices to aid in policing in the 20th and 21st century. This aids verisimilitude.                              |
| This enforces verisimilitude.                              | Costume, Hair & Make-up:<br>makeup<br>high-vis<br>suit                                             | Clothing styles and products suggest that this is a middle class location, 20th century. This aids in the verisimilitude of its genre          |
|                                                            | Facial Expressions & Body Language:                                                                |                                                                                                                                                |
| This makes the clip realistic.                             | Lighting & Colour:<br>led lights<br>shiny surfaces                                                 | Late 20th century and 21st centuray materials used to make the artificial lighting and floor, desks, walls etc all reienforce the time period. |
| This does not aid in the verisimilitude, but is realistic. | Positioning:<br>Hiding<br>sneaking<br>walking quietly<br>following                                 | This suggests that they are not working together, the protagonist opposes the lady                                                             |

verisimilitude is how real the world of the story or narrative of a fiction media product apperas to the audience.

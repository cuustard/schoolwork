It should be regualted:

- Moral panic
- social learning
- hypodermic needle
- cultivation

It should not be regualted:

- Uses and gratification
- Pick 'n Mix

The media should be regulated to protect the audience (especially children) from media deemed harmful.  
For example, in Love Island 2021, 2 contestants, faye and teddy were in a toxic relationship - in that they were always arguing. Their biggest argument lead to ofcom recieving over 24,000 complaints about it. This was due to the profanity and overall rampagous toxicit. This can have a negative effect on the audinces social behavious. This is supported by Albert Bandura's Audience Social Learning theory which is the idea that audiences (especially children) lean social behavious through observation and that this learning is sccelerated when observing through television. The main audience of Love Island is 16-29 year-olds being 45% of the total viewers. This means that of all the people that watch Love Island, most are of a younger demographic and are therfore more susceptible to the negative social behavious displayed on Love Island. This can obviously be applied to the media as a whole and therefore should be regulated.  
  
However, you could argue that the media should not be regulated as any and all media is needed and should be accessible to any audience.  
For example, in terms of Love Island, you could argue that the audience can chose wether to watch it or not as well as which messages to take from the show. This is supported by Stuart Halls Audience Reception theory in that as long as the audience are being either negotied or oppositional readers, then as active audience members, they have the ability to decide for themselves. This is also supported by Blumer & Katz's Audience Uses and Gratification theory which describes the audience actively seeking out media for, entertainment and diversion, personal relationships/companion, personal identity, or surveillance and information. In terms of Love Island, The audience may be seeking it out for personal identity. Some may think this is a bad thing as Love Island has bad representations of social behavious, but as long as the audience is active then they can actively interpret but not accept these social behaviou. This can obviously be appliedto the media as whole and therfore does not need to be regulated.  
  
Therefore, it is clear that the media should be regulated

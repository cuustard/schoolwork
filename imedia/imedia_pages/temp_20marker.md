It should be regualted:

- Moral panic
- social learning
- hypodermic needle
- cultivation

It should not be regualted:

- Uses and gratification
- Pick 'n Mix

The media should be regulated to protect the audience (especially children) from media deemed harmful.  
For example, in Love Island 2021, 2 contestants, faye and teddy were in a toxic relationship - in that they were always arguing. Their biggest argument lead to ofcom recieving over 24,000 complaints about it. This was due to the profanity and overall rampagous toxicit. This can have a negative effect on the audinces social behavious. This is supported by Albert Bandura's Audience Social Learning theory which is the idea that audiences (especially children) lean social behavious through observation and that this learning is sccelerated when observing through television. The main audience of Love Island is 16-29 year-olds being 45% of the total viewers. This means that of all the people that watch Love Island, most are of a younger demographic and are therfore more susceptible to the negative social behavious displayed on Love Island. This can obviously be applied to the media as a whole and therefore should be regulated.

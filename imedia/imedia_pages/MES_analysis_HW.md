The settings & props make this clip's verisimilitude realistic. This is shown by the electronic devices, such as computers, printers, phones, watches, etc. Electronic devices were not massively consumed by enforcement agencies until the late 20th, and the 21st century. This enforces the realism of the clip.  

The costume, hair & make-up also enforce the clips verisimilitude. This is shown by the clothing (suits, high-vis vests, etc.)and the make-up (make-up was not worn by many people, especially mass-produced for people in the past). This shows that the time period and era do match up with the genre and therefore enforce the verisimilitude.  

The body language aids in verisimilitude. This is shown by the fact that the protagonist's facial expression and body language shows him being concerned, rushed, sneaky and tense. Therefore, this shows that the character matches the genre of the film. 

The lighting and colour partly aid in the verisimilitude of this clip. This is shown by the artificially made, artificial lighting used for the electric lights in the police station. They use more low-key lighting to create a dark, suspicious sense. Therefore, this matches the genre and reinforces the verisimilitude.  

The positioning does not aid in the verisimilitude but does make the clip realistic. This is shown by the way the protagonist was moving, sneakily, hiding, walking slowly, and following. This does not aid in verisimilitude as these actions can be found in any genre, time period and social class, but this does make the scene realistic to the story.

# Characters in The Outlaws

## 3 key findings

- Was intended to be a movie at first, but character development was not deemed reachable in movie length.
- Strangers with different backgorunds unite to complete their sentece
- characters are forced to unite to protece one of their own from Bristols most dangerous gang. (personal identity)

Tv shows are episodes and so have breaks inbetween episodes. This pause creates a stop in the flow. This stop can be used to create cliffhangers (suspense) and used to start a parralel narratives or split up todorovs stages of a narrative into episodes. so each episode can focus on a stage.

## Why are characters so important to media texts.
Characters drive the narrative forward.  
uses and gratification - personal identiy - relatable characters  
David Gauntless - pick n mix, audiene uses characters to pick traits to identitfy with  

## Character types (Propp's character theory)
### The Hero

- leads the narrative
- ususally the story of their mission
- aims to fix problem
- saves princess
- strong, brave, resilient, determined
- most relatable
- other forms like the civtim in a narrative told by that victim

eg the doctor


### The sidekick

- Supports the hero on their journey.
- There is a relationship between the helper
- and the hero. This relationship usually shows
- off the greatness of the hero. Helper regularly saves the hero or helps and a critical point.
- Usually funny, light and good.
- Audiences like the helper but probably wouldn't want to be the them.

eg rose tyler


### The Villain

- Fights against the hero.
- Tries to stop the hero reaching their goal.
- Clearly the bad one.
- Usually the character the audience like/relate to least.
- Tends to be dark, mysterious for a part of the narrative, evil, ugly or disfigured (think horror movies or Voldemort).

eg the master


### The False Hero

- Deceptive, sneaky and often spoilt character.
- Tries to take credit for the work that the hero has done.
- Acts as hero but tries to work against the hero in secret.
- Often tries to 'marry' the 'princess'.
- A variation of the villain.
- May win the trust and respect of the princess's father, thus angering the hero.

eg

### Princess

- Usually the prize or reward for the hero.
- May be searched for and rescued resulting in a reward or may simply be the reward.
- The princess may be the quest.
- Beautiful, perfect, good.
- Usually all good but rather helpless.

eg

### Princesses father

- Usually gives task to the hero.
- Can act as dispatcher.
- Either constrains princess or sends hero
- to save her. The hero regularly needs to persuade or seek approval form the father as he
- usually cares for princess.
- Authoritative figure.
- Offers reward

eg

### The Dispatcher

- Sends hero on their journey.
- Exposes and highlights the villain's evil.
- Wise, knowledgeable, experienced - knows more than hero.
- Can be combined with another role, such as
- princess's father or false hero acting as
- helper, sending the hero on a trap journey.

eg


### The Donor

- Prepares hero for their quest.
- Gives the hero magical object that will help them defeat evil and complete their mission.
- Can be an object or simply information.
- Regularly nerdy/knowledgeable. Again regularly combined with other roles.

eg that goose from adventure time

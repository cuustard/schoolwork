## 1 (b) Explain how a public service company operates differently to a commercial company. Use an example to support your answer. [4]

A public service company is funded by consumers by a fee, and/or by the government as a PSC is a government provided good. For example, the BBC is funded by an anual fee of Â£140 a year per TV liscence. This is different to a commercial company as the objective of a commercial company is to make profit. They are not government funded and use money gained from adverts and subscriptions to make more content, all while making enough profit for effective synergy.

## 2 Explain two advantages of vertical integration, using examples from a media company you have studied to support your answers. [4]

The first advantage is that the media company has it's own production, distribution and consumption implementations. Such as Netflix, has it's own production studio (Netflix), then they distribute the Netflix products onto Netflix, and finally they allow the audience to consume the produts on Netflix only.  
The other advantage is that the media company will have more creative freedom due to being in complete control of production, distribution and consumption. As they do not have to censor anthing for certain consumption brands, TV channels etc.

## 3 Explain two disadvantages of being an independent company. Use examples to support your answer. [6]

One disadvantage of being an independant company is that because they specialise in only 1 type of media, and sometimes one genre of that media, they rely heavily on that product or genre of products. So if the genre of product becomes unpopular, the independant company will begin to do badly. For example, epic games became popular because of Fortnite.  
The other disadvantage is that they are not owend by a conglomerate company so have little to no aid in funds for production. This means that they msy be financially unstablein the future.

## 4 Explain how two jobs roles in a media sector you have studied contribute to the production phase of a media product or brand. [4]

A folley artist is responsible for the production of audio effects using physical objets. Folley artists are needed as sound effects are not normally recorded during the recording of a scene. These sounds are edited out and replaced with the folley artists sounds.  
The make-up artist is responsible for the look of the actors. This is very needed as the actor could look very different in one scene compared to another. The make-up aids in versimilitude.

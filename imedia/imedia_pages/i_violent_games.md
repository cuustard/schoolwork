# Do Video Games Make You Violent?

## What is Charlie Brooker's point of view in the video?

In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sGNidyvLVM&ab_channel=zthemusic" target="_blank"> video extract</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/13/charlie-brooker-modern-warfare-3" target="_blank">article</a>, Charile Brooker displays his disbeliefs in the beliefe that video games do make you violent. He does this by arguing that the only issue with these violent games is that the character the user controls is violent.

## Do I agree? Why/why not?

I believe that video games do not make you violent. I believe that video games give users a sense of control in a world that they can't do that very thing. They allow users to escape to a reality free of rules, restrictions, real-life problems.<br>Therefore they become violent in the games but not in reality. When they leave the game, they leave the sense of control and become controlled.

## What are valid points in essay as compared to article?

The <a href="https://www.banyeresdelpenedes.com/an-outstanding-essay-sample-on-violent-video-games.asp" target="_blank">essay</a> the stated that although violent video games rarely have any (significant) violent effect on children, the addiction did nothing but hinder their educational and social elements of life. This differes to the article as this highlights the behaviour of the controllee and argues that this behaviour is not a good example for children.
